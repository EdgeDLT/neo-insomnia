# neo-insomnia

Last Updated: Neo v3.1.0

A full collection of requests for use with Neo N3 RPC endpoints. The collection is based on the core [Neo node](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-node) API; other clients (e.g. [NeoGo](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neo-go/blob/master/docs/rpc.md#implementation-notices) may have slight differences in supported methods or behavior.

Three environments are provided: one for MainNet, one for TestNet, and one set up following the [Neo Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express) defaults. You can change the nodes used for each network using `Manage Environments` (CTRL+E).
